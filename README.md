# Cancer_Predictor-ANN

Binary Classification using Artificial Neural Network

this Artificial Neural Network contains:
- 2 Hidden layers using relu as the activation function in the neurons.
- for the Uutput layer the activation function in the neurons is sigmoid.

the trained model had an accuracy of 94%.
